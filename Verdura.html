          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Traditional educational systems often have a blind spot when it comes to plant
            sciences. This results in a significant gap in our collective knowledge and appreciation
            for the plant world. Plants are the silent powerhouses of our planet, playing a critical
            role in maintaining the delicate balance of Earth's ecosystem. From producing the oxygen
            we breathe to providing the base of the food chain, plants are the foundation of life on
            Earth.  Their intricate beauty goes beyond aesthetics, with unique adaptations and symbiotic
            relationships that sustain entire ecosystems.  Unfortunately, current educational approaches
            often fail to capture this wonder. Textbooks and lectures often present a dry and one-dimensional
            view of plant life, neglecting the fascinating stories behind their growth and survival. This
            lack of engagement affects people of all ages, from students who might lose interest in pursuing
            plant-related careers to adults who lack a deeper understanding of the natural world around them.
            This knowledge gap hinders our ability to appreciate the interconnectedness of life and poses a
            challenge for future generations who will need to be responsible stewards of the environment.

          <h3>VR Headset Selection </h3>  
          <p>
            Verdura prioritized selecting a VR headset that
            could deliver an exceptional user experience while considering factors like
            accessibility, target audience, and content compatibility. Here's a breakdown
            of the VR headsets explored during the research phase:
          </p>
          <ul class="left__list">
            <li><b>Oculus Quest 2:</b>This standalone headset offers portability, a large and
              growing library of games and applications,
              and a user-friendly interface, making it a strong contender for Verdura.
            </li>
              <li><b>Valve Index:   </b> Known for its high-fidelity visuals and precise
                tracking, the Valve Index caters to a more enthusiast audience but might
                not be ideal for Verdura's broader target demographic due to its higher price point.
              </li>
              <li><b>PlayStation VR (PSVR): </b>While cost-effective and leveraging the PlayStation
                user base, PSVR requires a PlayStation console, limiting accessibility.
              </li>
              <li><b>HTC Vive Cosmos Elite: </b> Offering a good balance of features and
                ease of use, the Vive Cosmos Elite was another potential candidate.
              </li>
              <li><b>HP Reverb G2:</b> This high-resolution headset prioritizes visual
                quality but might not be the most cost-effective option for Verdura.
              </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p> From all thesd considerations Oculus Quest 2 was selcted to

        <li>Participants were briefed on the prototype content before playing it.
        </li>
          <br>
          <li>An initial round of questioning was followed by a replay
            with video pauses at specific points to capture user feedback on visuals and understanding.
          </li>
          <br>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Key Findings:

          </b></p>       
          <ul>
            Visual Clarity: All participants agreed that the prototype's visual clarity needed improvement, making it the top priority for future iterations.
            <br>
            <br>
  
  
          <li>Speed and Noticeability: The information presentation speed was too fast, and the green bubbles highlighting information points were not easily noticeable due to size and color.

          </li>
            <br>
            <li>Immersion: Opinions on immersion were divided (50% positive, 50% negative).
              Interestingly, all online participants felt immersed, while none of the in-person
              participants did. This suggests potential
              influences of factors like the "bystander effect" and comfort levels in different environments.
            </li>
            <br>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Additional Feedback:

            </b></p>       
            <ul>
              Text size and highlighting of difficult words were suggested for improved readability.

              <br>
              <br>
    
    
            <li>Users recommended including audio or text narration for guidance.

            </li>
              <br>
              <li>VR interface improvements were noted, such as a non-floating
                side menu and missing exit controls in pop-up boxes.
              </li>
              <br>
              </ul>      
          <br>
          <p>
            Overall, the user testing yielded valuable insights to refine the
            VR botany prototype. Addressing visual clarity, information presentation speed, and user
            interface elements will be crucial in creating a more engaging and effective learning experience.

        for small which affected the readability and the close button was not there
        which might leave the audience clueless after reading it, whose font size has
        been increased by 4 points, the plant was emphasized with a glowing effect in
        the background of it and a closing button
        has been given at the top to make sure that the users can close them after reading them.

        created to identify which questions
        are they on and how many are left. Also the labelling for options were changed to YXBA from ABCD.
