        <p>
            "Globast," an inclusive movie streaming application was developed focused on
            providing an equivalent and enjoyable movie-watching experience for individuals
            with diverse abilities. The project began with an exploration of the challenges
            faced by users with disabilities on existing platforms, leading to a thorough
            disability analysis drawing from key literature papers.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Visual Impairment:</b> Individuals experiencing difficulty seeing text, images,
                        and navigating interfaces may find it challenging to interact with computers and digital
                        devices in the usual way. This can include problems reading on-screen content due to blurry
                        vision, difficulty distinguishing colors or contrast, or trouble perceiving the layout and
                        functionality of buttons and menus. As a result, they might require assistance using traditional
                        interfaces, such as someone magnifying text on a screen, 
                        reading content aloud, or providing guidance on navigating a program's features.
                     </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Auditory Impairment:</b> Trying to decipher what's happening on screen can be
                          frustrating when the audio isn't cooperating. The dialogue might be mumbled and faint,
                          lost in a sea of booming sound effects or an overpowering soundtrack. This uneven mix makes
                          it difficult to follow the plot, catch jokes, or appreciate the emotional moments. Whether
                          it's a movie, TV show, or even a video game, this
                          struggle to hear all the audio elements can leave you feeling disconnected from the experience.
                       </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><b>Physical Impairment:</b> Physical limitations due to conditions like arthritis,
                            tremors, or carpal tunnel syndrome can make precise movements or gripping objects
                            difficult. Similarly, reduced dexterity or weakness in the hands and arms can
                            impede using a keyboard or manipulating a mouse. Touchscreens can also be
                            challenging for users with limited hand-eye coordination or tremors, as selecting
                            small targets accurately can be frustrating.  Even for people without physical
                            limitations, some users may find touchscreens less intuitive than physical keys,
                            especially for extended typing or complex tasks.
                         </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Cognitive Impairment:</b> Sometimes we can hit a wall when trying to take
                              in too much information at once. This can be especially true with complex
                              instructions. When faced with a lot of details or steps, it might feel like
                              our brains are overloaded. This can lead to confusion, difficulty understanding
                              the overall task, and even forgetting important parts of the instructions.
                              It's like trying to fill a cup with water from a fire hose - the water just
                              spills over the brim!
                           </li>
                              
                          </ul>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Visual Impairment:</b> For users with visual impairments,
              navigating the Globast interface can be difficult. To ensure readability,
              Globast utilizes high contrast design with the ability to resize text.
              Integration with screen readers allows content to be vocalized, while
              image descriptions convey visual information. Additionally, Globast
              explores offering Braille or tactile interfaces for users who cannot
              see the screen.
            </li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Auditory Impairment:</b> For users with auditory impairments,
                following dialogue and sound effects can be challenging. Globast
                provides closed captions and subtitles, with customization options
                for size, color, and font. Descriptive narration, known as audio
                description, explains non-verbal auditory cues like sound effects and
                background noises. Sign language interpretation videos are also offered
                for users who rely on sign language. Advanced volume controls allow users
                with hearing loss to amplify sound.
             </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Physical Impairment:</b> Globast recognizes that using a mouse,
                  keyboard, or touchscreen can be difficult for users with physical
                  impairments. Globast offers voice control, allowing users to navigate
                  and control playback with voice commands. Keyboard shortcuts provide
                  alternative navigation methods. For users with limited mobility, switch
                  control enables operating the interface with specialized switches. Globast
                  is also exploring eye tracking technology for users who can control the
                  interface through eye movements. UI elements are designed with larger size
                  and spacing for easier interaction.
               </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><b>Cognitive Impairment:</b> Understanding complex instructions and
                    processing information overload can be difficult for users with cognitive
                    impairments. Globast maintains a clean and uncluttered interface with
                    clear and concise labels. A consistent layout across the platform reduces
                    confusion, while clear and straightforward navigation options make browsing
                    effortless. Content is organized logically and by category for easier
                    exploration. Globast avoids overwhelming users with too many choices at
                    once, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable streaming experience.

          <p>
            The low-fidelity phase involved creating a paper prototype for the application.
            This prototype outlined the basic structure, user interface, and key features. The
            initial design focused on inclusivity, incorporating features like audio descriptions,
            subtitles, voice assistance, and blocked captions. This phase allowed for quick
            iterations and adjustments based on feedback.

      <p>
        User testing was conducted with 4 participants (visually and auditory impaired)
        to understand how well they interact with Globast, an inclusive movie streaming platform.      </p>

        <br>
               
          <p>The testers were given 5 tasks to complete:</p>
         

          <ul class="left__list">
        <li>Find and play "The Batman" movie in the superhero genre.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Find and play "The Batman" movie with Chinese subtitles.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>See the cast and crew for "The Batman" movie.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Change the audio description voice for "The Batman" to sound like Robert Pattinson.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Switch user profiles from Sherlock to Heisenberg.
          </li>
          <br>
          </ul>

          <p>The time to complete each task was recorded, and testers were asked
          for their feedback on the platform.After the main testing, there was an
          engagement usability test where participants could explore the platform
          freely and provide feedback on how engaging it was. They were given a
          questionnaire to fill out at the end.</p>
